                <p><em> Operations Manager at IGT Solutions and Software Engineering Student </em></p>

                <p>
                    Passionate about continuous processes improvement and technology. Naturally curious, I’ve discovered a recent
                    interest for coding, so I decided to go back to university. I am a second year Software Engineering student.
                    Complimentary I also study Python programing language, web development, iOS development and AWS cloud.
                    I am originally from Brazil and based in Dubai since 2011. I can speak Portuguese and English fluently,
                    conversational Spanish and risk a few words in French.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a goal-focused and success-driven professional, I have a progressive experience in operations and key
                    account management; backed by adeptness in optimizing operational performance and driving revenue growth.
                    I am known for expertise in hiring qualified talents and building top-caliber workforce, thus preventing
                    staffing gap. This involved creating and implementing training programs and materials focused on upskilling
                    employees and aligning their performance with organizational requirements. In addition, I am keen at addressing
                    areas for improvement and arising problems by creating viable solutions and executing strategic plans.
                    Throughout my career, I have exemplified effectiveness in forging beneficial relationships and collaborating
                    with multicultural professionals by leveraging solid interpersonal and multilingual abilities. Through this,
                    I was able to convey organizational mission and objectives to target audience. It also helped in guaranteeing
                    the delivery of best-in-class customer service and accomplishment of organizational goals.
