    <h1>MBA in Supply Chain Management</h1>
    <p>
    I have always been curious about the Supply Chain Management. As a kid, I used to walk to my small town highway to observe
    the container trucks rush through the highway with their heavy loads. Little I knew at that time that Supply Chain it is
    much more than the transport of goods via highways. This course taught me the wide reach and the crucial importance of the Supply Chain.
